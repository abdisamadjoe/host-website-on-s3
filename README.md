# How to Host a Static Website Using Amazon S3 

This project shows you how to use Amazon S3 to host a simple static website. It‚Äôs a great way to publish HTML, CSS, and images online ‚Äî without needing a web server.

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is part of AWS, and it can store your website files and serve them through a web link. It‚Äôs free for small projects if you stay within the AWS Free Tier (5 GB storage for 12 months).

S3 is also cheap. If we go to the official S3 Pricing page, we can see the storage and bandwidth costs are low for most users.

**Create a Bucket**

Give it a unique name (like `mystaticwebsite-joe`) ‚Äî every bucket name must be unique worldwide.

It automatically chooses your selected region ‚Äî for me, it was **Cape Town (af-south-1)**.  
Just scroll and create. No need to change anything else.

---

**Turn On Static Website Hosting**  
Once the bucket is created, go to the **Properties** tab.  
Scroll down to **Static website hosting** and click **Edit**.  

Choose **Enable: Host a static website**, and set the **Index document** as `index.html`. Then click Save.

After saving, scroll down again to the **Static website hosting** section ‚Äî you‚Äôll see the web hosting endpoint.

Try opening that link in the browser ‚Äî at first, it gives a **403 Forbidden** error.

To fix this, we need to make the bucket public.

---

**Allow Public Access**  
By default, your bucket blocks public access.  

Go to the **Permissions** tab, find **Block public access**, and click **Edit**.  
Uncheck ‚ÄúBlock all public access‚Äù and confirm the warning.  

This will make your files viewable on the internet.

---

**Add a Bucket Policy**  
Next, go to **Bucket Policy** under the Permissions tab.  

Click **Edit** and paste the policy that gives everyone read access to your files.

‚úÖ You can find the full JSON code in `bucket-policy.json` in this project.

---

**Upload Your Website Files**  
Now go to the **Objects** tab and click **Upload**.  

Add your `index.html` file and any other files like images or CSS.

---

**Open Your Website**  
After everything is set up, go back to the **Static website hosting** section.  

You‚Äôll see your **Endpoint** ‚Äî that‚Äôs your live website link.  
Click it to view your site in the browser.
